# Hibernate Relations Project
### Description:
This project ilustrates the use of Hibernate in Java to manipulate a MySQL database. It focuses on managing a database with tables related by primary and foreign keys, representing clients and orders.

### Features:
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the Client entity.
CRUD operations for the Order entity.
Implementation of relationships between clients and orders.

### Project in Progress!
This project is still in progress. Currently, the basic CRUD functionalities and relationships between tables are implemented, but the Orders table still needs to be added and fully implemented, along with some additional tweaks to increase the complexity of the project. Weâ€™re moving forward!
